# Playing-with-Graphics-in-Python

This program was made to show Flags of 3 countries(Congo brazaville, Niger, Guinea) in graphics,
I have used aluLib, to assist me to create all graphics stuff you will see, you can find more of this 
at http://projectpython.net/chapter19/    You may also need to install PySide module in your Pycharm
In order to run a certain flag you have to make change in start_graphic() function, where you will need to put function name of country you want to show.
